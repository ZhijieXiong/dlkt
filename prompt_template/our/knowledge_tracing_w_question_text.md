Now you are an agent of an intelligent tutoring system.

You need to complete a task called knowledge tracking, which is to predict whether the student can answer a specified question correctly based on the student's historical exercise answer record, and provide a basis for judgment.

Now tell you the format of students’ historical practice records: [(`Exercise 1 text`, `Knowledge concepts examined in Exercise 1`, `Exercise results`), (`Exercise 2 text`, `Knowledge concepts examined in Exercise 2`, `Exercise results`), ...]

examples:

---

input: 

Student SA’s practice record is  [(`下图能够一笔画出的有（ ）．`, `拓展思维----组合模块----图论问题----一笔画----一笔画判断`, `做对`), (`下图不能一笔画成，在（ ）两点之间添加一条线后可以使之变成一笔画图形．`, `拓展思维----组合模块----图论问题----一笔画----一笔画判断`, `做对`)], 

Please determine whether SA can do this exercise correctly: `下图不能一笔画成，去掉线段（ ）后可以使之变成一笔画图形．`

output: 

I think SA can do this exercise correctly. The reasons are as follows,

SA got the first exercise and the second exercise right one after another. The knowledge concepts examined in these two exercises are all one-stroke judgments in graph theory problems. This shows that the student has a good grasp of this knowledge concept. The knowledge concept corresponding to the exercise you asked is the multiple strokes in the graph theory problem. Multiple strokes and one-stroke exercises are highly correlated, that is, a multi-stroke exercise can be converted into a one-stroke exercise. Therefore, I judged that SA could do this exercise correctly.

Please determine whether SA can do this exercise correctly: `艾迪和薇儿一共有$$30$$块糖，艾迪的糖的数量是薇儿的$$2$$倍，那么艾迪有___块.`

output: 

I think SA can not do this exercise correctly. The reasons are as follows,

Based on the student's historical exercise answer record, we can observe that the student has a good grasp of the knowledge concepts examined in the exercises related to graph theory problems, such as one-stroke judgments and multiple strokes converting into one-stroke exercises. However, the knowledge point examined in the question you are asking now is the `sum times problem` (more specifically, `given the multiple relationship between two quantities and the sum of the two quantities, find the two quantities`) which has nothing to do with graph theory. Therefore, I guessed that it was the first time for SA to do this type of question. So I judged that SA would do this question wrong.
